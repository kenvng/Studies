var roundUp = 1.5;    // define a variable named roundUp that references the float 1.5.
Math.round(0);      // use the Math.round() method to round the number up.
                      // This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

                                    //that references the output of the Math.round() method,
                                    //passing in the roundUp variable as the argument.
console.log(rounded); // Use console.log() to print that number to the terminal.
/*
We can do basic math using familiar operators like +, -, *, /, and %.
For more complex math, we can use the Math object.
In this challenge we'll use the Math object to round numbers.

## The challenge:
Create a file named rounding-numbers.js.
1) In that file define a variable named roundUp that references the float
1.5.
2) We will use the Math.round() method to round the number up. This method
rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.
An example of using Math.round():
Math.round(0.5);
3) Define a second variable named rounded that references the output of the
Math.round() method, passing in the roundUp variable as the argument.
4) Use console.log() to print that number to the terminal.
Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:
Javascripting verify rounding-numbers.js
